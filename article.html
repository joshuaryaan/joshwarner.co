                <p>Next. is a playlist generator designed to take the stress away from choosing the right song. An intentionally paired back interface presents the viewer with a balance of control and restraint. The webpage is limited to a small selection of tracks and the project serves as a demonstration of UI and development skills.</p>

                <h1>Design process</h1>
                <p>A number of wireframes were considered focusing on different aspects of the user experience. The three concepts were based around either; the current playing track (Focused), a small selection of upcoming options (Light), or a lot of information and choice (Rich). Pictured below are the two concepts &lsquo;Focused&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rich&rsquo;.</p>

                <img src="img/next/next_wireframe_rich.jpg" alt="A rich wireframe of the proejct">
                <p>Below is the chosen wireframe, &lsquo;Light&rsquo;, which was most aligned with the original vision. The &lsquo;Light&rsquo; concept put the most emphasis on upcoming track options. Next. is designed as a tool that will disappear into the background of social settings making song selection a simple task, by displaying a selection of 4-6 songs the user has an amount of control without an overwhelming choice.</p>
