                <p>In this post, I’m going to lay out a case for an intermediary format between design and engineering tools to enable more efficient, capable tooling for product teams generally and designers especially. This proposal is based on a series of conversations I’ve had with small groups of designers and engineers over the past year or so. If we can provide appropriate context, our computers can do the work of translation between design and development processes for us. This should remove a significant amount of work and confusion between teams and enable individuals and companies to focus on harder, more important problems.</p>
